      Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by
      Psyonix. The game was first released for PlayStation 4 and Windows in July
      2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch being released later on.
      In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for
      PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment
      taking over those duties by the end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux
      were also released in 2016, but support for their online services were
      dropped in 2020. The game went free-to-play in September 2020. Described
      as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight
      players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles
      to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course
      of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can
      be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between
      all versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify
      core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey
      and basketball. Rocket League is a sequel to Psyonix's Supersonic
      Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, a 2008 video game for the
      PlayStation 3. Battle-Cars received mixed reviews and was not a success,
      but gained a loyal fan base. Psyonix continued to support themselves
      through contract development work for other studios while looking to
      develop a sequel. Psyonix began formal development of Rocket League around
      2013, refining the gameplay from Battle-Cars to address criticism and fan
      input. Psyonix also recognized their lack of marketing from Battle-Cars
      and engaged in both social media and promotions to market the game,
      including offering the game for free for PlayStation Plus members on
      release. Rocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over
      Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars, as well as its graphics
      and overall presentation, although some criticism was directed towards the
      game's physics engine. The game earned many industry awards and saw over
      10 million sales and 40 million players by the beginning of 2018. Rocket
      League has also been adopted as an esport, with professional players
      participating through ESL and Major League Gaming along with Psyonix's own
      Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).
